# How to run Pet-Ecom

This project is created using Create-React-App which is the official supportedd way to create single-page React applications.

## Available Scripts

### `cd frontend/app for Design implementation 1`

Primary script we will be using for development is `npm start or yarn start`:

If it is your first time using this code: run: "npm install" or "yarn" to create the node_modules

`npm start` or `yarn start` - to run the project

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
